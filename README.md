# When_ones_not_enough
Code used in paper:  When oneâ€™s not enough: Colony pool-seq outperforms individual-based methods for assessing introgression in Apis mellifera subspecies

The file CSV to ped was used to convert the SNP array raw data into a ped file for use with ADMIXTURE.

The file named vcf_to_colony_allele_frequencies.py takes in a vcf file created by GATK, calculates allele frequencies from the AD column and outputs a large dataframe of allele frequencies for all samples.

abba_baba_colony.py perfroms D statistics, significance testing and f statistics on colony allele frequencies data frame obtained from a vcf file format. The input data frame for which needs to be sample names as a header and rows of SNPs.
